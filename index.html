        <h2>Developer’s Note</h2>
        <p>When designing Datale Verse of NASA, our goal was not only to provide players with a gaming experience but also to create an adventure environment where they could shape the story with their own choices. Each option takes our character's journey in a different direction and allows players to directly see the consequences of their decisions. This game aims to provide an experience that is both entertaining and thought-provoking. Your choices affect the world of the game as much as the character's experiences. Your feedback is invaluable to us; Every day we strive to provide a better gaming experience.</p>
